# USA_Food_Imports

• In this project, I haveanalyzed the dataset of USA Food Imports from 1999 to 2022 with values in millions of dollars using Google Sheets. I utilized various features such as conditional formatting, functions, pivot tables and charts to visualize the data, enabling users to track long-term growth patterns. The dataset was obtained from Data.gov and provided by the Department of Commerce, U.S. Census Bureau.

#### From the analysis, i found interesting questions like:
1. What are the lowest and highest import values for each food category and each subtotal food from 1999 to 2022?
2. Which food category and which subtotal food have the highest and lowest import values from 1999 to 2022?
3. What are the total import values for each year?
4. What is the total amount of imports for the period from 1999 to 2022?
5. Which year has the highest and lowest import value from 1999 to 2022?

• The dataset consists of details such as food category, subtotal food, and imports values from 1999 to 2022, represented in millions.
